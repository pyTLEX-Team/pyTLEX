print("In an Event object, each must have an event id and a class, but some also have stems")
print("In Timex objects, each must have a tid, value, temporal function, phrase")
print("the optional variables in timex objects include type, mod, documentFunction, quantity, frequency, \n"

next()

print("You can take the time now to pause the video and compare these to the manually built photo of the graph on th"

print("You'll notice that there are 11 nodes and 13 links captured")
print("Each one of these IDs represent a node object, which can have values like part of speech or modality")

print("one thing to note here is that these nodes now have minus and plus postfixes")

next()

print("We can see the main timeline has 8 sections")
print("and from the previous slide, we can know that sections 1-5 are indeterminate")
print("The subordinate timelines deal with the subordinate partitions, we can see that timeline 0 "

print("and because timelines 1 2 and 3 deal with singletons, they only contain the starts and ends of "
